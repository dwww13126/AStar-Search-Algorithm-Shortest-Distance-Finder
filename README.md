# AStar-Search-Algorithm-Shortest-Distance-Finder

Project from COMPX301 Design and Analysis of Algorithms where we were to design a program which takes in an ASCII map and uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest route to the goal. The heuristic function in determining which path to expand is Euclidean distance. The final path result is displayed via a grid of different colored buttons with Black being the obstacles, White being the tiles not travelled and Green being the tiles travelled.

## Setup Instructions

1. Compile: "javac AStar.java"

2. Run the program: "java AStar <NameOfMap>.txt"
